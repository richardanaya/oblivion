                        We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Your shields were failing, sir. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. The unexpected is our normal routine. How long can two people talk about nothing? Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Travel time to the nearest starbase? They were just sucked into space. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Not if I weaken first. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Sorry, Data. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Besides, you look good in a dress. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? I guess it's better to be lucky than good. I'll alert the crew. Your head is not an artifact! Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Wouldn't that bring about chaos? The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Ensign Babyface!
